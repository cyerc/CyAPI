# Roblox Lua CyAPI

CyAPI is a lightweight utility framework that provides an easy way to manage `RenderStepped` and `Heartbeat` callbacks in Roblox.  
It helps you keep your code clean, organized, and optimized by avoiding scattered connections, which can heavily affect performance.

I originally created this API for personal use, but decided to release it on GitHub in case others find it useful.

##How to use the API:
```lua
local CyAPI = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyerc/Source"))() 
```
